Introduction
    This page contains software and instructions for Canoical Time Warping (CTW) [1]. All the functions have been written and documented in Matlab format. We additionally provide C++ implementations of some dynamic programming routines which involve many loops and are notoriously slow in Matlab.

Installation
    1. unzip aca.zip to your folder;
    2. Run make.m to compile all C++ files;
    3. Run addPath.m to add sub-directories into the path of Matlab.
    4. Run demoCtw file.



Instructions
    The package of aca.zip contains two folders, two setup files and one demo file:
    ./src: This folder contains the main implmentation of CTW.
    ./lib: This folder contains some necessary library functions.
    ./make.m: Matlab makefile for C++ code.
    ./addPath.m: Adds the sub-directories into the path of Matlab.
    ./demoCtw.m: Alignment of a pair of synthetic sequences by CTW.
    


Other Tips
    For each C++ code, we provide its corresponding Matlab version. For instance, you can use "dtwFordSlow.m" instead of "dtwFord.cpp". They have the same interface in both input and output. The C++ code is faster to obtain result while the Matlab version is easier to understand and debug.
